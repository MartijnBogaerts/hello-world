# hello-world
my first repository 

Hi there, my name is Martijn Bogaerts.
I started programming a few years back like, e.g. html/css for a website www.wakairyu.nl. Only recently I started doing python course and I try to write some code for the development of Primed Editing experiments in our lab.

Stay save, stay healthy in these strange Covid-19 times.
